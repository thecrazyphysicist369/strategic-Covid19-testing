# Strategic Covid19 Testing

Via this project we tried to estimate what would be the minimum number of testing to be done in a pandemic affected small world netwrok to recover from the pandemic. We also analysed 3 forms of testing and compared their results.

## Abstract


## Components

### Epidemiological Compartmental Model

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### [Watts-Strogatz Small World Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts%E2%80%93Strogatz_model)

This is a special type of graph, a small world, which depicts the human dynamics of real world in a fundamental level without all the real world abstractions.
Watts-Strogatz small world network uses 3 variables to define the network.

1. ***Nodes              =  n***   _The total number of nodes in the Small World_
2. ***Nearest neighbors  =  k***   _The number of nodes each node is connected to. Also called nearest-neighbors_
3. ***Probability        =  p***   _This is the length of connection of the edges_

## Executing the Code

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### The Simulation

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

#### Input Value execution

Explain what these tests test and why


#### Slider execution

Give an example
```

## Results

Discuss the results include how the number of tests per day affects the network.
