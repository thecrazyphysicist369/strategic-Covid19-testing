# strategic-Covid19-testing
Via this project we tried to estimate what would be the minimum number of testing to be done in a pandemic affected small world netwrok to recover from the pandemic. We also analysed 3 forms of testing and compared their results.

## Abstract

The project can be directly executed from the browser. But if you intend to use it locally then you'd need these packages.

## Components

### Epidemiological Compartmental Model

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Watts-Strogatz Small World Network

Talk about the watts-strogatz network

```
Give the example
```

### Testing Strategies

Few lines about how the testing strategy differs

#### Random Testing
About Random testing

#### Targeted Testing
About targeted testing

#### n-Neighbor Testing
About n-Neighbor testing


## Executing the Code

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### The Simulation

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

#### Input Value execution

Explain what these tests test and why


#### Slider execution
```
Give an example
```

## Results

Discuss the results include how the number of tests per day affects the network.
